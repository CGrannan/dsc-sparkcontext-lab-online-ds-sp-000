        "\n",
        "The following series of PySpark lessons and labs in this section will provide you with an introduction to **Apache Spark**, the leading framework for big data processing in jupyter notebooks and PySpark, using a PySpark docker image in a standalone mode. These lessons require you to explore the spark documentation and practice methods and properties which are not directly covered in the labs. In this first lesson, we'll look at creating a spark session, called a Spark Context and explore its properties. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab you will: \n",
        "\n",
        "- Describe Spark's parallelism with master and executor nodes \n",
        "- List the major properties and methods of SparkContext \n",
        "- Define a SparkContext and why it is important to a spark application \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cluster Resource Manager\n",
        "\n",
        "Spark comes bundled with a **Cluster Resource Manager** which divides and shares the physical resources of a cluster of machines between multiple Spark applications. Spark's **standalone cluster manager** operates in the standalone mode and allows Spark to manage its own cluster on a local machine. We will mainly use the standalone cluster manager for resource allocation in these labs. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Spark computational model, communication routinely occurs between a **driver** and **executors**. The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the workers for completion. The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver. \n",
        "\n",
        "This image, taken from the [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html) demonstrates this process well.\n",

        "\n",
        "> The machine on which the Spark cluster manager runs is called the **Master Node**. \n",
        "\n",

When we run any Spark application, a driver program starts, which has the main function and your SparkContext gets initiated here. The driver program then runs the operations inside the executors on worker nodes as shown above.\n",
        "\n",
        "SparkContext uses Py4J to create a bridge between Python and Java, the language spark is built with. Even though all the code we'll be executing is in Python, Java is the code being executed underneath the hood in a JavaSparkConext. You'll see in error messages that they will frequently contain errors related specifically to Java. \n",

This can occur either locally on a single machine using multiple cores to create parallel processing or across a cluster of computers that are controlled by a master computer.

The driver program contains the key instructions for the program and it determines how to best distribute datasets across the cluster and apply operations to those datasets.\n",
